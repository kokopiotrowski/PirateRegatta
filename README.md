This is demo version of the Pirate Regattas game - for passing GMD1 course. 
This demo's functionalities are very limited in comparison the wanted final version which will include:
- wind direction
- fighting
- random events
- procedurally generated maps
- different types of boats
- crew choice
- redone sprites and original music score made by Konrad Piotrowski :)
and much more...


In order to complete development of this demo I used:
Brackeys Youtube Tutorials (Menu, Pause menu)
Dice tossing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouGJJzNPsSk) including simple dice asset.
A few PNG images from Google Images (for woodflooring and walls)
Official Unity hex grid movement video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcPqdCSGCls)
Music used for the game is included in YT playlist here - https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4aAptNC81fcW55kEbIy_gzA82jfHwR6s
